# hello_name
# Given a string name, e.g. "Bob", return a greeting of the form "Hello Bob!".
# Here is my code:

def hello_name(name):
  return "Hello " + name + "!"

# Very easy, very quick
# My code is identical to th√© solution

# https://codingbat.com/prob/p182144
# Given two strings, a and b, return the result of putting them together in the order abba, e.g. "Hi" and "Bye" returns "HiByeByeHi".
# Here's my code:

def make_abba(a, b):
  return a + b + b + a
  
# Their code is the same as mine, but without the parentheses.

# make_tags
# The web is built with HTML strings like "<i>Yay</i>" which draws Yay as italic text. In this example, the "i" tag makes <i> and </i> which surround the word "Yay". Given tag and word strings, create the HTML string with tags around the word, e.g. "<i>Yay</i>".


def make_tags(tag, word):
  return "<" +tag + ">" + word + "</" + tag +">"

# make_out_word
# Given an "out" string length 4, such as "<<>>", and a word, return a new string where the word is in the middle of the out string, e.g. "<<word>>".

# extra_end
# Given a string, return a new string made of 3 copies of the last 2 chars of the original string. The string length will be at least 2.
# Here's my code:

def extra_end(str):
  return (str[(len(str) - 2):] * 3)

# My first thought was to slice it from back to front.
# But I'm not sure that's possible.

# first_two
# Given a string, return the string made of its first two chars, so the String "Hello" yields "He". If the string is shorter than length 2, return whatever there is, so "X" yields "X", and the empty string "" yields the empty string "". 
# Here's my code...

  if len(str) < 2:

# first_half
# Given a string of even length, return the first half. So the string "WooHoo" yields "Woo".
# Based on the instructions, I believe I am to assume the given string is even.
# Here's my solution...

def first_half(str):
  return str[:(len(str) / 2)]

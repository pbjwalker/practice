# make_tags

def make_tags(tag, word):
  return "<" +tag + ">" + word + "</" + tag +">"

# I got a gold star for this one

# extra_end
# Given a string, return a new string made of 3 copies of the last 2 chars of the original string. The string length will be at least 2.
# Here's my code:

def extra_end(str):
  return (str[(len(str) - 2):] * 3)

# My first thought was to slice it from back to front.
# But I'm not sure that's possible.

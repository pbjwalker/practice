# hello_name
# Given a string name, e.g. "Bob", return a greeting of the form "Hello Bob!".
# Here is my code:

def hello_name(name):
  return "Hello " + name + "!"

# Very easy, very quick
# My code is identical to th√© solution

# make_abba
# https://codingbat.com/prob/p182144
# Given two strings, a and b, return the result of putting them together in the order abba, e.g. "Hi" and "Bye" returns "HiByeByeHi".
# Here's my code:

def make_abba(a, b):
  return a + b + b + a
  
# Their code is the same as mine, but without the parentheses.

# make_tags
# The web is built with HTML strings like "<i>Yay</i>" which draws Yay as italic text. In this example, the "i" tag makes <i> and </i> which surround the word "Yay". Given tag and word strings, create the HTML string with tags around the word, e.g. "<i>Yay</i>".


def make_tags(tag, word):
  return "<" +tag + ">" + word + "</" + tag +">"

# make_out_word
# Given an "out" string length 4, such as "<<>>", and a word, return a new string where the word is in the middle of the out string, e.g. "<<word>>".

# extra_end
# Given a string, return a new string made of 3 copies of the last 2 chars of the original string. The string length will be at least 2.
# Here's my code:

def extra_end(str):
  return (str[(len(str) - 2):] * 3)

# My first thought was to slice it from back to front.
# But I'm not sure that's possible.

# first_two
# Given a string, return the string made of its first two chars, so the String "Hello" yields "He". If the string is shorter than length 2, return whatever there is, so "X" yields "X", and the empty string "" yields the empty string "". 
# Here's my code...

  if len(str) < 2:

# first_half
# Given a string of even length, return the first half. So the string "WooHoo" yields "Woo".
# Based on the instructions, I believe I am to assume the given string is even.
# Here's my solution...

# without_end
# Given a string, return a version without the first and last char, so "Hello" yields "ell". The string length will be at least 2.
# Here's my code:

def without_end(str):
  return str[1:(len(str)-1)]

# This just takes a slice of the string starting at index position 1.
# It gets the length of the string, subtracts 1, and that is the end index position for the slice.
# There's no CodingBat solution for this one.

# combo_string
# Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form short+long+short, with the shorter string on the outside and the longer string on the inside. The strings will not be the same length, but they may be empty (length 0).
# Here's my code:

def combo_string(a, b):
  if len(a) < len(b):
    return a+b+a
  else:
    return b+a+b

# I got a gold star for this one!

# non_start
# Given 2 strings, return their concatenation, except omit the first char of each. The strings will be at least length 1.
# Here's my code:

def non_start(a, b):
  return a[1:] + b[1:]

# I just concatenated the slices of each string starting at index position 1
# There's no CodingBat solution

# left2
# Given a string, return a "rotated left 2" version where the first 2 chars are moved to the end. The string length will be at least 2.
# Here's my code:

  return str[2:] + str[:2]

# I got a gold star for this one!
# At first, I sliced the string wrong, but it was an easy fix.
# My solution was exactly like the CodingBat solution
